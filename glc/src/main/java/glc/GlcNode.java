 * Node object used in motion planning search tree
 * 
 * The Node object in the glc library will always belong to a motion
 * planning search tree. Each Node contains pointers to its parent
 * and children in the tree. A Node is also associated to a state in
 * the state space as well as a cost to reach that Node via the path
 * from the root of the tree. The node also has an attribute "merit"
 * which is the cost from the root together with the estimated
 * cost-to-go which is used in the A*-like search.
