# Example Project

To start a new project:

* fork the whole main2023 repo into your own account.
* create a branch for your project.
* create a directory, like this one, for your project.
* write a README file describing what you're doing.
* if you're using WPILib, you could use a template to create a subdirectory.  Look at the swerve100 example.
