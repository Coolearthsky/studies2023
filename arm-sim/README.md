# 2-DOF Arm Simulation

Open this folder in vscode, find Arm.java, and click "Run without Debugging" in the top menu.

This illustrates spring-counterbalanced two-jointed arm design.
The ulna is coupled to a linkage via an angular constraint that represents a simple belt.
The red lines are zero-rest-length springs, like the Funky Monkey video.
Play with the masses (adjust "density") and spring constants in the "bicep" and "deltoid" joints.
